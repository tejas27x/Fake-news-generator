# Fake News Generator 🗞️

So this is a small Python script I made because I was bored and wanted to try something fun.  
Basically, it creates random “breaking news” by mixing a name, some random action, and a place.  
Nothing serious… just for fun. And yeah, it also speaks the news out loud using pyttsx3.

I’m learning Python right now, so this project was mainly to practice how loops, functions, and libraries work.  
Surprisingly it turned out kinda funny, so I decided to put it here.

## Why I made this

Nothing big — just practicing Python basics like loops, random choices, functions, and working with a library.  
Thought it would be cool to upload my first small project to GitHub.  
Maybe I’ll add more actions, locations, or features later if I get ideas.
